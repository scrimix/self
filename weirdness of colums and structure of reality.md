Columns. Here is a weird thing I've noticed from Nausica and Bloodborne (also Dark Souls). 
These columns lore-wise hold worlds, but also purify. But in any case look bizarre.

Trees. Forests. They share a similarity to columns. Also the Tree of Life. Dark Forest. Is where heroes go, into the unknown. Also Sagrada Familia. Had trees as columns of the cathedral. Roots into Hell, branches into Heaven. Bridge. Wood Wide Web.

Mountains. They form a hierarchy. With God (most valuable) at the top. Also look like a binary tree from computer science. Also look like a cathedral.

Neurons. Look like trees. There are grid cells to encode placement. Numenta and thousand brain theory. They form a network. They map out the territory (reality) with value. They are in a form of a sheet. Curled.

Fractals. Self-similar. Plants have fractals everywhere. Also spirals.

So.. we have a grid of columns. But also a spiral. But also a triangle. But also a network. As above, so below...
