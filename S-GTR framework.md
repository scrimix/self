As Above, So Below

---

Spiral 🌀 
circle, sine, oscillation, DNA, time, growth, pathway, pendulum, chaos

Grid 🗺️
space, map, columns, neurons, matrix, gradient
  
Tension 🔥
stored energy, chemical bonds, force, potential, pull/push, {-1,0,+1}, value

Relation 🕸️
sequence, hierarchy, set, network, coupling

----

Fractal whirlwinds

tension
layer of columns
time
chain

universe, milky way, galaxy, earth
waves (light, sound, quantum)
Sin, cos, circle, phi, golden ratio, pendulum, chaos
DNA - two "bonded" spirals, a script
Cell - a vortex, energy-in, waste-out

grid (map)
tension (fuel)
spiral (movement)

combinatorial explosion
infinite memory
sparse coding

grid needs to also be fractal (or hierarchical) (car/door/window)

gradients (1.....-1...1..1...-1....1)
sound waves (positive, negative pressure)
cell positioning

machine hearing, cochlea, grid, HTM, sparsity, sound, whirlwind
reverse fractal
**inverse fractal transform**


Left-Right, Up-Down Oscillations on top of a 3D spiral is a pathway.
Oscillations are complex wav signals like music.
Animation, 3 or 4 loop-level spiral, outline, dot running through, starts, fades.
Exploding all-at-once in all directions.
If you add... repelling & merging logic:
Blue+Blue repell, red+red repell
Red+blue=merge into purple. Other colors then repell to their negative.
Start with 50 spirals.
Then increase the speed of dots (loop from the beginning)
Scale up to infinity.
Play around with different rules.
Form galaxies.

Each of us is a beautiful spiralling painting 🌀 🖼️
