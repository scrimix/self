I wanted to explain the process of how I got here.

As I see it, at the core of this process is my curiocity. (Einstein, following burning bush)
My parents told me that at the age of 5 I was constantly asking "Why?" questions. Почемучка.
Why this, why that, but then why this. And at some point my parents were so tired by my questioning that they said "I don't know! Because! Stop asking questions!".
And to some degree, I've internalized this. I've actually stopped questioning for a long time.
And was just living my life, attending to present life's issues and events. But I've also internalised that most people get tired by these sorts of questions quite quickly, so I was mostly hiding my intensity of thought to myself. And I don't mean it judgementally, people have different interests and thinking deeply just isn't one of them. So It's... fine, although feels lonely at times.

So... I was living life stuff. Learning to play on the piano, going to gymnastics. Playing with friends. Then there was a difficult decision - where should I go? Continue going to school or give up my friendships and pursue programming, go to college? Here I want to express my gratitude to my mother - she insisted that I should to go college, although I resisted. But at the same time I've felt that... it was the right decision, that I'm on the right path.

So I studied, then I've got a job. First day at work. My first "real" program. Without any guidence. Just a problem given. Go. Really disorienting. Chaos. But also I'm learning to think for myself for the first time. Then as years went by I've got better and better at this, I've also developed some insights into software engineering (those will be a seperate series). I was questioning what is code quality? It's like...elusive. And how do I write programs better? Whatever that means?

Bloodborne. Having this sense of something there, blindly reaching towards it.
Writing down words and concepts that seem relevant. Building maps of meaning.

Then at the age of 23 I've started having existential crisies. I had two questions in mind:

"That's it?" as I was studying in university, I had this sudden realisation that... I'm already on a trajectory - like I have a well-paid job, soon I'll buy a car and an apartment, find girlfriend and create a family. A sense that I've done all that I needed to do, those things will come as life unfolds. You would think that it's a positive thing, but it's not. It's actually a crisis of meaning. Because I didn't know "what's next?" and "what do I want from life?", what's my goals? I felt completely lost. I've lost the sense of meaning, like everything is already determined. Somehow I was expecting that life should be an adventure with unknown things ahead. And this sense was missing. Nothing felt exciting or interesting... I was just living. But also in a sense... I've started questioning. The "why"-kid coming back to life. I was on a quest.

"Why am I so different?" I went online and tried to find some psychological tests, starting with choleric, flegmatic, etc. To understand myself. Eventually I've discovered Big-5 and MBTI. Found out I'm INTP. And in some sense, this personality is the cause of my interests but also the cause my problems, like having difficulty in social interactions, being awkward, absent-minded etc. Don't get me wrong, I'm not making excuses, just that those things are harder for me to learn. Or in other words, I have difficulty creating a persona that would "vibe" with other people.
So, this understanding gave me some healing, but at the same time... I was quite negative about myself. Like this INTP thing is more like a curse, than a gift. It's hard to find my place in the world.

Peterson youtube videos. Was the catalyst. I saw something... a deep well of knowledge and understanding that I could explore. So, that's how I was gaining knowledge. I've watched many youtube videos and lectures, trying to figure things out. But also it was just entertaining to me. As the time unfolded and recommendation systems evolve I've started to diversify my knowledge. (Also soulsborne games lore).

Pillars of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Nausica seem...bizzare, out of place.
