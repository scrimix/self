Existential crisis
Who am I? Why I feel so different?

The obsession.
Tension, sense of something being there within grasp.
Unrest. Nothing matters...except this.
Something pulling me, pushing me.
Always there in the back of my mind.
Becoming more intense.

I've felt judged. By myself and others. For overthinking.
And not doing things I "should", like finishing university.

This is the Daimon.

### What does the Self mean to me?

S1 -> S2

Self is the throughline of our being. That which unites the many parts into a coherent whole.
Self is the music that harmonizes by the beating of our hearts.
Self is autopoetic, endlessly forming.
Self is the breath that ebbs and flows, homeostatic.
Self is between. Self is above.
Self is a process that lives. Self is a structure that joins.
Self is a whirpool on the fabric of reality.
Self is I. The person I am.
The way I feel. What excites me, the way I talk.
The way I’m lost and anxious. Confronting the future.
The way I live. Trusting my intuition, embracing whatever might be.
Being entangled in the beauty and tragedy of human condition.
Self is more than I, as it contains the potential.
Self is that which I might become, that which I admire or that which I despise.
Self is the flow of our life, the energy that longs for connection.
Self are the two dragons going up and down the Tree of Life, forming infinity.
Self is the Comet, shimmering in the night sky…

I'm grateful for those people who have supported me, discussed and engaged with the topics.
I've had these glimpses of hope that what I'm doing matters. That it's important and might be interesting to other people.
Just like any creative person, I have all sorts of doubts, but these notes of encouragement give me the strength to go on.

If you see this... glimpse of genuine spirit of good in someone else, please, encourage it... it's so vulnurable... Critique if it goes astray of course, but with respect. And if you yourself have this glimpse, pay attention, notice it. Believe in it. However things might turn out, they will be the very best and most valuable and meaningful, even if it doesn't look that way. It just might be the catalyst we need.
