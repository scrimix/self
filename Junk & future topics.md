Psyche - personality, ego, superego, shadow, persona, childhood;

Questions:

Is there an aspect that is missing?
How to find the higher self? What should I aim at?
Where belief comes from?
Is meaning a feeling, a sense? A form of judgement?
Is creation the most sacred act?
How does opponent processing affect the aspects?
Why the friction to act exists? Why do we default to cheap consumption?
What lies in the shadow? How it affects us?
How self-story is forming itself?
What is causing the rise in mental health issues like depression, anxiety?
Are depression and anxiety illnesses of the Self?
Can a self exist without tightly connected body?
Why ego-dissolution removes suffering?
Are all aspects necessary to form a self?

Free Will.
Can qualia cause change?
Free Will is action aligned with True Self. Sacred Second self?
True Self can only be found, created and becomed at the same time.
Free will is a degree of awareness, examined and self-reflected action.
It's in the pause and in the formation of the Self. With realised shadow.
As opposed to acting upon primordial spirits.
We do not understand:
- quantum physics
- dark matter and dark energy
- consciousness and qualia
- chaos and complexity
- synchronicity, NDE and other phenomena
- the Self
- free will as in definition
But somehow people claim that free will doesn't exist.

Arcane season 2. Need to think this through.

Triggers for each pillar. What makes them affect the Self.
What are the principles of the flow.
- opponent processing
- value hierarchy
- awareness
- Anagoge. Sacred Second Self.

I want the Self to feel real and important. Touch upon the symbolic world.
Reveal structures and patterns. Find the guiding principle towards meaning.
Build a framework of thought for issues like propaganda.
How ideologies become parts of the Self.

Sense of Meaning and psychic trips.
"Yes! That's it! Carrots! That's the answer!"
All the while meaning nothing.
Meaning is a form of judgement, both sensed and reasoned.
It's similar to importance, value, insight, salience.
Religious revelations.
Shamans.

What is the ground of the Self.
Prima Materia. Gives rise to the universe, life and qualia.
Structure of Reality. Structure of the Self.
Whirpool. Mountain. Columns. Neurons. Trees. Two Dragons. Comet. Ein Sof.
Self as the bridge between mind and body.
Prima Materia is that on which the Self is whirling.
But how the matter is formed from it?
Forest, Opponent processing, Oneness.
This is the structure of Reality. And maybe the structure of Prima Materia.
Many, Two, One.
Big Bang. Fractals (self-similarity). Expansion. Spiral.
Perceptions of reality as mirrored structures.
Structure of our brain mirrors structure of reality.
Mountain represents a hierarchy (fractals again?). Summit is good (God). Also N21 | 12N

Communication. Signals. Compression. Repetition.
Prime organism. Reflecting in itself the senses of the body. Why?
To form a map. Of the territory, but also itself. Grid cells.
There is this map. There is also value. Food.
Okay, and then there is opponent processing.
Cost of the energy vs value of the reward. Agency. Decision-making.
But is this op-p sufficient?
Maybe the want to live. What else?

Oneness. What makes a bunch of cells one organism. The Self.
Boundary. Encapsulation. Self-replication. Proto-cell.
That which formed chemical bounds into a cell.
Non-random process. Energy like a whirlwind. Stillness within.
How does the energy of the wind translate into absorbing energy through matter.
The structure of the cell.
Proto-Self.
Sun,orbit,spiral. The beginning of the universe.
As above, so below. Motion. Radiation.
Wind, water, rock, sunlight + radiation (energy). Break apart chemical molecules.
Sequences of molecules. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, phoshorus.

Ant colonies. Self that has multiple bodies. Hyper-objects.

Michael Levin. Cells. Organisms. Selflets.

Black Sun.
Crisis. Event. Darkness of the Soul.
Qualia in depression becomes grey.
Sense of Meaning is suppressed in depression.
Identity collapse. Motivation system collapse.
Identity orients actions.
Losing yourself is the path to finding yourself.
Existential crisis. Dark Forest.
Hero's Journey.

The Archetypes.
Are examples of the Self. Characters.

Tarot. Arcana. Chakras.

The real problem is how qualia arises from matter.
Air. The Edge. Beyond reality. Heaven. The Ether.
Deja Vu. Dreams. Daimons. Angels.
NDE. Blindsight. Morphic resonance. Synchronicity.
Buttefly effect. Past lives. The Divine. Psychodelics.
Collective Unconscious. Collective Memory.
Manifestation of energies across space.
What happens after death. It's like there persists a kind of memory, spirit.
Butteflies having a new body... with an old memory (self).
Spirituality. Concerts. Entranced.
Kundalini. Third Eye. Reincarnation.
Imaginary numbers. 5th dimension. A plane of qualia.


The Other. Two whirlwinds meet. What it means to know another person.

Colums. Are wierd. Holding worlds and realities.

Build an artificial self.

Symbols represent multiplicity of meanings and relations.
The symbol of a messanger. White dove with an olive branch.

The symbol of the Self.
Tree of Life. Bridge between Heaven & Hell. Love and Suffering. Grace and Curse. Evolution.
Hourglass, two triangles facing with a rhombus, the Philosopher's stone inside.
Two dragons, each with a wing, facing each other, forming infinity. Dancing around the Tree. Ouroboros.
8 petal flames form a black sun, eclipse, each corresponding to corners of triangles and wings.
Surrounded by a plane of chaotic waters. Supported by the forest of columns encoding 
Entangled in the fractal spirals of the cosmos and cells. As above, so below.
Ein Sof.

Gods. Energies.
Killing them?
Death of God.
Can we build our own values?
How do they form to begin with?
How we decided that slavery is bad?
What is wisdom. (knowing the patterns of tension)
What is philosophy.

Love. Suffering. Unbearable.
The curse of creativity.

Nuclear laser weapon. The Eye of Sauron. Judgement day. Thanos.

Crow. Eye. The universe is looking at me. This silence... üïäÔ∏è

game of life
artists, weavers
flow state
know thyself
As above, so below
selflets
out-of-body memory

Value is simultaneously that which matters, is a number, is an evaluation which is a form of judgement and is emotion. It's good, bad, neutral. -1, 0, 1.
It's also sin and waves. It's also sound and music.
Value hierarchy. Is a fractal grid (gradient).
Authenticity. Personality.
Sin (evil). missing the mark. Sun?? Spiral! Goes towards the centre.
And at that centre is God! The highest good! Value hierarchy! Wow. Target function.

Wisdom. Socrates. Jesus.
God as a target function - the best way to integrate wisdom, love, truth, intuition, aim upward, sacrifices, withstanding suffering and having faith. The Holy Spirit. The spiral. Embodied.

Eye of the storm, stillness within.

Laws of Complexity. Chaos science.

Yin and Yang. Tension. Spiral. {-1,0,+1} grid.

Spiders!!!! 8 eyes!!! 360 degree qualia

For some reason there exists Holy Spirit which leads to God? And it's consistent?
