Reincarnation. Out-of-body memory. Energies. grid of values (like image with pixels), bounded version is personal "qualia" segment, but also spider has 8 eyes (360 degree) as opposed to our 2 eyes, so the qualia boundary extends. But at the same time, people with blindsight can "sense" things through intuition, somehow. As if they can sense a qualia pertrubations nearby, outside it's direct boundary. If hemispherectomy produces... two integrated parts of qualia? Why does one control the body? Whales who sleep, something have two qualia-bounded instances?

Cell positioning and out-of-body memory. Are things that are like primal forms.

Our brain is a structured map of reality (grids,networks,hierarchies). It maps the external and internal world through senses. It learns repeated signals, can be thought of as a decoder of fractals, making inverse fractal operation. As a proto-brain, you can imagine a primitive organism that was mapping a 2D territory on the bottom of the ocean, trying to find food. It knows it's location (grid cells), and has high activation when stumbling upon food. Also, it can be thought of as a grid of values {-1,0,+1}, a gradient. These values also relate to positive, negative. Proto-emotions.
Now, imagine an image, which has 200x200 pixels (containing HSV values). This is like a boundary of your perception, your bounded qualia. If we had 8 eyes like spiders, it would be more wide (but a lot more blurry). Imagine sound being similar, a grid of frequencies (x axis -> time, y axis frequency). Imagine every other information in a similar grid-like way. When you close your eye, it's not like you see black, you just see less (the boundary shrinks). Our experience is unified into a single grid of values with time being the major uniting principle.
I posit that this qualia grid is like an imaginary 5th dimension which gets phase-locked when our brain is at the point of criticality. The patterns of activity in our brain correlate with the qualia grid, the same energy goes on in both planes.
Here are the wild parts. Now, imagine that two bounded qualias being close to each other in that grid. And through that sheet of experience we can sense echoes of other people experiences. This for example, might explain how a completely blind monkey could "see" black and white things on the ground. Lab experimentors were training the monkey to perceive perceptions of other people by feeding it stuff, so that it learned to correlate it's senses with food.
Now imagine that when a person dies, it's bounded qualia remains. And if another person is reborn and somehow can perceive that left-over, then it can remember things from another life by having the same patterns of activity. Even wilder is the question of how cells decide on their positioning (remember the gradients?). If qualia can somehow affect this, then it might explain birthmarks that people have.
There are other magic-like things that are hard to explain. Deja vu. Synchronicity. NDE. There are all these senses that are very hard to scientifically study. But I think with relating things together and studying qualia on it's breaking points, might produce insights into the nature of reality.
On this note, I also want to mention Morphic Resonance and Morphic Fields, seems like Sheldrake got to the same intuitive understanding.
