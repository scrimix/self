Feeling inadequate, not good enough, feeling like a failure.
Hating yourself for the way you are.
For your looks, your personality, lack of discipline.
Being anxious and afraid of judgement by others.
Being introverted and neurotic. Being different.
Good deeds, good skills? Those do not sink in. Those do not matter, those are not true.
Your ideal, society's ideal. And the huge gap, from *you*. That's what matters.
It forms a parasite, growing inside, feeding anxiety and depression.
Not having wealth creates all sorts of difficulties and lack of opportunities.
But having wealth doesn't bring happiness anyway.
Because it's all in your head, it's all your fault.
You are lost. Not knowing how to be or where to go.
You are hurting. The gaping hole in your soul, longing for meaning... that never comes.
Health declines, relatives die. Losing your job, business, relationships. Having addictions.
Uncertainty of the future. Covid, AI, wars, climate, economy, politics, dating, birth rates. Everything is bleak.
Life outside, Self inside. Bad, bad, bad... judgement, judgement, judgement... spiraling down...

The nature of good and bad, the transjective value. It's the result of judgement. Without judgement value doesn't exist. Dynamic and relative nature. Transjective standard. Culture. "Good" person. Ideal man or woman. Transgender isn't normal. Virtues. Morality. Needs. Wants. Comparing. Social status. Conscience. Value hierarchy. Cancel culture. It's all because I'm black. Capitalism. Seeking wealth. Money as a proxy for value.
It's a set of complexies in your head, growing from life's experiences... parents, friends, stories, social media. Regulated by serotonin that existed for millions of years.
And you cannot lie to yourself. "I am a beautiful being" doesn't work.
The ideal is transjective, formed by logic and opinions from others.
You internalise that ideal and judge yourself and being judged by others.
Judgement is the cause of value and dukkha.
Normativity.

The goal of Buddhism is to alleviate dukkha. Liberation from suffering, dissatisfaction, desires.
The idea is... acceptance brings peace. But being hungry or lonely, having your leg torn apart or betrayed by a friend isn't just "dissatisfaction". Those are real problems, real sufferings, emotional and physical pain. So, Is acceptance a solution or... delusion?

Christianity. Sacrifice.
Christ. Sin. Redemption. Heaven and Hell.
Judgement (of goodness) is at the core of conscious life and humanity, as described in Adam and Eve story.
Good and Evil. Being naked. Being aware of judgement.

The Shadow. The Ego. The Persona.
Repression, rejection.
Collective Unconscious. Archetypes.
Alchemy and individuation.
Ideal you vs ideal person.

Justification. Agency. Motivation.
Cat. Just being. Or questioning it's existence. It's value.
Finite Transcedence.
Living in the Spirit. Connects you to the Greater Whole.
Awareness is a curse.
Existential Depression.

Agency.
Act A1 (30e + 10f) -> leads to Value B (5d + 5s).
Act A2 (50e + 20f) -> leads to Value C (3d + 10s).
Act A3 (2e + 0f) -> leads to Value D (2d - 3s).
Value C > Value B.
Therefore Act A2.
Distorted.

Knowing all of this. And yet.
How to transcend. How to find the wisdom.

Embracing life and self.
Allow things to be.
Notice translucent happiness.
A moment. A laugh with friends, a walk with partner.
When you just are and feel connected.
Feel the breeze of the wind in a warm summer evening.
Somehow. Somewhere. There are people who value you more than you can imagine.
Notice and recognise the judgements.
Work on stuff that you feel judged for.
Get up from failure.
Individuate.
Love life quietly and believe in yourself.
